## Key Components to Implement

### 2. Hero Section

- Full-width background image with overlay
- Prominent headline "Secure Your Dream Vacation With a Reservation"
- Search form with location, check-in/out dates, and guests count
- Property type filters below the search form

### 3. Location Selection

- Horizontal scrollable cards for different locations
- Each card with location image and name
- Visual indicators for hover/active states

### 4. Property Listings

- Grid layout with responsive cards
- Each card showing:

### 5. Footer

- Logo and company information
